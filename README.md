## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Typescript
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - TDD
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) - TDD
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Dev Environment
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - For dimension

### What I learned

Used TDD to guide development in order to test features, provide predictable results, and have confidence in the code

To run locally

```bash
git clone
cd
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Continued development

In order to improve user interaction, I wanted to incorporate 3D capabilities into the program. Three might make a fantastic candidate.
